# Q1.

## Calculate 4+5-6
```{r}
4+5-6
```
## Calculate the square root of 25
```{r}
sqrt(25)
```
## Create a new object y and assign it to the value 100
```{r}
y <- 100
```
## Calculate the logarithm to base 10 of y (hint: use log10() function)
```{r}
log10(y)
```
# Q2.

## Generate 1000 random numbers from a normal deviation with mean 0 and standard deviation 10. (Do not print out the 1000 numbers on the solution document.) Save the results into object x.
```{r}
x <- rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 10)
```
## Plot a histogram for x object. (Hint: use hist() function)
```{r}
hist(x, col = "blue")
```

## Calculate the mean and variance of x. (Hint: R already has a built-in function to calculate variance, search online to find this function)
```{r}
mean(x)
var(x)
```
